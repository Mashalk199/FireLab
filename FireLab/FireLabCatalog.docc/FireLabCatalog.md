# ``FireLab``

This app will calculate your earliest possible retirement plan. Provide your details and your investment preferences, and the app will calculate the amount of your income to send to your brokerage account/s and the amount to contribute towards your superannuation account. It will also display graphs visualising the user's financial journey.

## Overview

The app will ask the user in the beginning to provide details of their current situation, income, age and expenses. Then their investment plans can be customised in the subsequent screen. After that, the calculation results are displayed, with an option to visit the graphs screen.
